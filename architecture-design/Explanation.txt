For RecipeStudio, I recommend the following tech stack:

Frontend

Framework: NextJS for server-side rendering
State Management: Redux for global state, React Context for local state
Styling: Tailwind CSS
UI Components: Material UI/Shadcn
Client-side Validation: Formik with Yup
Image Optimization: Next.js Image component


Backend
API Framework: NextJS
Authentication: JWT
Real-time Updates: Socket.io for notifications

Database
Primary Database: PostgreSQL
Caching Layer: Redis (for session management and frequent queries)
Search Engine: Elasticsearch (for advanced recipe search capabilities)


Third-party Services
Cloud Storage: AWS S3
CDN: Cloudflare (for serving static assets)
Email Service: SendGrid (for notifications and password resets)
Analytics: Google Analytics


MICROSERVICES
1. Authentication Service
Handles user registration, login, and token validation
Manages role-based permissions

2. Recipe Service
Creates, reads, updates, and deletes recipes
Manages recipe status (draft, published)
Handles recipe filtering and search queries

3. User Service
Manages user profiles and preferences
Handles user collections (saved recipes)
Maintains user activity logs

4. Comment/Interaction Service
Manages comments, likes
Generates notifications
Moderates user-generated content

5. Feed Service
Generates personalized and trending recipe feeds
Implements caching for popular content


KEY INDEXES IN DATABASE DESIGN
users(email) - For fast login lookups
recipes(user_id) - For finding recipes by author
recipes(status, created_at) - For filtering published recipes by recency
likes(recipe_id) - For counting likes per recipe
comments(recipe_id) - For fetching comments for a recipe
notifications(user_id, is_read) - For fetching unread notifications
recipe_categories(category_id) - For filtering recipes by category
recipes(cooking_time) - For filtering by cooking time

SCALABILITY PLAN

Horizontal Scaling
Containerization: Deploy services as Docker containers
Orchestration: Use Kubernetes for container management

Database Scaling
Sharding: Partition data by geography or user segments as the platform grows
Read Replicas: Create PostgreSQL read replicas for heavy read operations

Caching Strategy
Multi-level Caching: Browser cache → CDN → Redis
Cache Invalidation: Implement smart invalidation to refresh content only when needed

Stateless Services
Design all services to be stateless to allow for easy scaling
Store session data in Redis instead of server memory

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

Frontend Optimization
Code Splitting: Lazy load components based on routes
Image Optimization: Serve different image sizes based on device
Bundle Optimization: Tree shaking and minification of assets
Progressive Loading: Implement skeleton screens during data fetch

Backend Optimization
Query Optimization: Use database indexes effectively
Batched Processing: Process notifications in batches
Rate Limiting: Implement to prevent abuse of API endpoints
Background Processing: Use job queues for non-immediate tasks

Feed Performance
Personalization Algorithm: Implement efficient sorting based on user preferences
Pagination: Use cursor-based pagination for feed items
Windowing: Render only visible items in long lists
Predictive Loading: Pre-fetch next page of content

Database Optimization
Denormalization: Store computed values like comment counts directly on recipe records
Query Caching: Cache frequent queries in Redis
Partial Indexing: Index only published recipes for certain operations
